# SponsorLink React App

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configure API Calls

Update the API calls in the following files to point to your local or production Django server:
- `Explore.jsx`
- `postModal.jsx`

**Note:** The app is not currently set up to use environment variables for local/production differentiation. This will be implemented in the near future.

## Deploying to Vercel

2. Link the repository and specify your branch for deployment.
3. Deploy your project directly from Vercel.
